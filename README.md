# NLP Model Exploration Repository

Welcome to the NLP Model Exploration Repository! This repo is dedicated to exploring various Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, from the foundational N-gram models to the cutting-edge transformers. Each model is implemented and documented to provide insights into its workings and applications.

## Overview

This repository aims to serve as a learning platform for those interested in the development and application of NLP models. We start with simple models and gradually progress to more complex architectures, highlighting how each model builds upon the previous.

## Models Covered

- **N-gram Models**: Understand the basics of language modeling and prediction using N-grams.
- **Sequence to Sequence Models**: Dive into models that transform input sequences into output sequences, useful for tasks like machine translation.
- **Transformers**: Explore the transformer architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms to handle long-range dependencies.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, clone it locally using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HusseinBitambuka/NLP.git
```

### Setting Up Your Environment

To ensure consistency across different setups and ease of package management, it is recommended to use a Python virtual environment. Here's how to set up a virtual environment for this project:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed on your machine.

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
   For Windows:

```bash
python -m venv nlp-env nlp-env\Scripts\activate

```

For macOS and Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv nlp-env nlp-env\Scripts\activate

```

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Install all necessary libraries to run the models using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn nltk transformers

```

### Key Libraries and Tools Used

- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for numerical computation in Python.
- **Pandas**: Provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.
- **NLTK**: A leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data.
- **Transformers**: State-of-the-art machine learning models for natural language processing tasks.
